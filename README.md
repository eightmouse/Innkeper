# Innkeeper

## Disclaimer
This app does NOT replace Armory in any way, shape or form.

It's a personal project to push my skills further while I play/learn the game!
I like the Armory, so I though of a similar but more digestible idea to display basic infos and have it on your desktop and keeping track of multiple characters.

## Note
Download is not available yet, I'm still building the app and I want it to have enough features and stability before releasing it to the pubblic.
