# Innkeeper

## Disclaimer
This app does NOT replace Armory or WoWHead in any way, shape or form. <br />
I strongly suggest using those since they have everything, quite thankful for them especially WoWHead, amazing resource!

## Description 
Innkeper it's a minimal World of Warcraft app to keep track of character informations. <br />
The app is fullly built in Python for the back-end and Electron on the front-end, I'm using Blizzard and WoWHead (to some extent) API for the data.

It's a personal project that I started a while ago to push my skills further while taking breaks between WoW sessions. <br />
Started building it few weeks prior to pushing it to GitHub, mostly due to the fact that I was not planning on actually developing something 'complete' but here we are. <br />

I like the Armory and WoWHeads, so I though of a similar but more 'digestible' idea to display basic infos and have it on your desktop. <br />
Started WoW not long ago and I found myself closing and opening WoWhead for builds over and over, I wanted something on my desktop that I could access quickly, because I'm lazy. <br />

## FaQ
***Q: Why Electron?*** <br />
*A: I know that it's quite hated for it's memory usage, super valid and agreable critique. I thought about other options but I'm not confident and skilled enough to use other frameworks. Tauri could've achieved same results with less memory usage but as I said, that would've been out of my skill reach!* <br />

***Q: Will you add X?*** <br />
*A: As I mentioned, the goal for this app is not to replace the resources already available but more of a 'quick but less' alternative. So, suggestions are welcomed but I can't guarantee I will add specific things unless they're more of a QoL than anything.*

***Q: Did you use AI to help you develop the app?*** <br />
*A: Yes. When used correctly it's an amazing tool that provides help. I see it no differently than using StackOverflow or Google, with the difference that at least I'm not get bullied for asking/expressing myself poorly. If this bothers you I apologize, this app might not be for you.*

## Notes
- Download is not available yet, I'm still building the app and I want it to have enough features and stability before releasing it to the pubblic.
