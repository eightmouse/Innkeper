# Innkeeper

## Disclaimer
This app does NOT replace Armory in any way, shape or form.

It's a personal project to push my skills further while I play/learn the game!
I like the Armory, so I though of a similar but more digestible idea to display basic infos and have it on your desktop and keeping track of multiple characters.

Download is not available yet, I'm still building the app and I want it to have enough features and stability before releasing it to the pubblic.
