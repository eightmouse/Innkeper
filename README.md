## Disclaimer
This app does NOT replace Armory in any way, shape or form.

It's a personal project to push my skills further while I play/learn the game!
I like the Armory, so I though of a similar but more digestible idea to display basic infos and have it on your desktop and keeping track of multiple characters.

## Description 
It's a minimal and simple World of Warcraft tracker to check basic informations such as:
- Activities
  - Raid
  - Mythic +
  - Expeditions
  - World Quests
  - Reset Timers
- Character Equipment
- More coming ~

## Note
Download is not available yet, I'm still building the app and I want it to have enough features and stability before releasing it to the pubblic.
